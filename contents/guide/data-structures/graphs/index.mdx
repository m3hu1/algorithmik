## <HoverUnderline>What are Graphs?</HoverUnderline>

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. Unlike trees, which have a strict hierarchical structure, graphs can represent more complex relationships where connections can form cycles and nodes can have multiple paths between them.

## <HoverUnderline>Types of Graphs</HoverUnderline>

1. **Directed vs Undirected**
   - **Directed (Digraph):** Edges have a direction (one-way connection)
   - **Undirected:** Edges have no direction (two-way connection)

2. **Weighted vs Unweighted**
   - **Weighted:** Edges have associated costs or weights
   - **Unweighted:** All edges have equal importance

3. **Special Types**
   - **Complete Graph:** Every vertex is connected to every other vertex
   - **Bipartite Graph:** Vertices can be divided into two sets with edges only between sets
   - **Tree:** Connected graph with no cycles
   - **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):** Directed graph with no cycles

## <HoverUnderline>Graph Representations</HoverUnderline>

1. **Adjacency Matrix**
   - 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` represents edge between vertices `i` and `j`
   - Space Complexity: `O(V²)`
   - Good for dense graphs

2. **Adjacency List**
   - Array/List of lists where each index stores connected vertices
   - Space Complexity: `O(V + E)`
   - Better for sparse graphs

## <HoverUnderline>Common Graph Operations</HoverUnderline>

- **Basic Operations**
  - Add vertex: `O(1)`
  - Add edge: `O(1)` for adjacency list, `O(1)` for matrix
  - Remove vertex: `O(V + E)` for list, `O(V²)` for matrix
  - Remove edge: `O(E)` for list, `O(1)` for matrix
  - Check if edge exists: `O(V)` for list, `O(1)` for matrix

- **Traversal Operations**
  - Depth First Search (DFS): `O(V + E)`
  - Breadth First Search (BFS): `O(V + E)`

       Dijkstra's Algorithm
       <div>
         Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights.

         ### How it works

         1. Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite
         2. Keep track of visited vertices
         3. For each unvisited vertex:
            - Find the vertex with minimum distance
            - Mark it as visited
            - Update distances to adjacent vertices

         ### Example Implementation

         ```python
         def dijkstra(graph, start):
             distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
             distances[start] = 0
             pq = [(0, start)]

             while pq:
                 current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)

                 if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
                     continue

                 for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex].items():
                     distance = current_distance + weight

                     if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                         distances[neighbor] = distance
                         heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

             return distances
         ```

         ### Time Complexity

         | Implementation | Time Complexity |
         |---------------|----------------|
         | Using array | `O(V²)` |
         | Using binary heap | `O((V+E) log V)` |
         | Using Fibonacci heap | `O(E + V log V)` |

         > Note: `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.

        Bellman-Ford Algorithm
        <div>
          The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights.

          ### How it works

          1. Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite, except the source vertex which is set to 0
          2. Relax all edges `|V| - 1` times, where `|V|` is the number of vertices
          3. Check for negative-weight cycles by verifying if any edge can be further relaxed

          ### Example Implementation

          ```python
          def bellman_ford(graph, start):
              distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
              distances[start] = 0

              for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
                  for vertex in graph:
                      for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
                          if distances[vertex] + weight < distances[neighbor]:
                              distances[neighbor] = distances[vertex] + weight

              for vertex in graph:
                  for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
                      if distances[vertex] + weight < distances[neighbor]:
                          raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")

          The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).

          ### How it works

          1. Initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix.
          2. Update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as intermediate vertices.
          3. For each pair of source and destination vertices, check if the path through the intermediate vertex is shorter than the direct path.

          ### Example Implementation

          ```python
          def floyd_warshall(graph):
              distance = list(map(lambda i: list(map(lambda j: j, i)), graph))
              V = len(graph)

              for k in range(V):
                  for i in range(V):
                      for j in range(V):
                          distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])

          Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm.

          ### How it works

          1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
          2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.

        Prim's Algorithm
        <div>
          Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that starts with a single vertex and grows the spanning tree one edge at a time, always choosing the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

          ### How it works

          1. Initialize a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph.
          2. Grow the tree by one edge: of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree, find the minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
          3. Repeat step 2 until all vertices are in the tree.

                      mst.append((frm, to, cost))

          1. Identify vertices with no incoming edges.
          2. Remove these vertices and their outgoing edges from the graph.

        Articulation Points
        <div>
          An articulation point (or cut vertex) in a graph is a vertex that, when removed along with its associated edges, makes the graph disconnected or increases the number of connected components.

          ### How it works

          1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph.
          2. Track the discovery and low values of each vertex.
          3. Identify articulation points based on the discovery and low values.

          ### Example Implementation

          ```python
          def articulation_points(graph):
              def dfs(u, parent, visited, disc, low, ap, time):
                  children = 0
                  visited[u] = True
                  disc[u] = low[u] = time[0]
                  time[0] += 1

                  for v in graph[u]:
                      if not visited[v]:
                          children += 1
                          dfs(v, u, visited, disc, low, ap, time)
                          low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                          if parent is None and children > 1:
                              ap[u] = True
                          if parent is not None and low[v] >= disc[u]:
                              ap[u] = True
                      elif v != parent:
                          low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

              visited = {u: False for u in graph}
              disc = {u: float('inf') for u in graph}
              low = {u: float('inf') for u in graph}
              ap = {u: False for u in graph}
              time = [0]

              for u in graph:
                  if not visited[u]:
                      dfs(u, None, visited, disc, low, ap, time)

              return [u for u in ap if ap[u]]
          ```

          ### Time Complexity

          | Implementation | Time Complexity |
          |---------------|----------------|
          | Articulation Points | `O(V + E)` |

          > Note: `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
