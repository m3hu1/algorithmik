## What are Strings?

A string is a sequence of characters. Unlike arrays, which hold homogeneous data (like integers or floats), strings are specifically designed for handling characters. Strings are `immutable` in many programming languages, meaning once you create a string, you can’t change its content directly.

### How Strings Are Stored

Let’s talk memory. In most languages, strings are stored as a continuous block of characters. For example:
- In `C++`, a string often ends with a null character (`'\0'`) to mark where it stops.
- In `Python` and `Java`, these details are abstracted—just remember strings are `immutable` in these languages.

When you think about memory, imagine a bookshelf where each slot represents a character in the string. If I have a string like `"Hello"`, it’s stored as contiguous slots with `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, and `o`. That’s why accessing the third letter is super fast—because it knows exactly where it is!

### Common String Operations

Here’s a quick list of some operations you’ll often perform on strings:
- **Concatenation:** Combining two strings.
- **Substring:** Extracting part of a string.
- **Length:** Finding out how many characters are in the string.
- **Search:** Checking if a character or substring exists within the string.

### Types of Strings

There are two main types of strings:
1. **Immutable Strings:** These are strings that can’t be changed after creation. Languages like Python and Java use this approach, which can be frustrating at first but helps with performance and security.
2. **Mutable Strings:** These allow direct modifications. For example, in C++, `std::string` is mutable.

### Code Examples

Here’s how you work with strings in `C++`, `Python`, and `Java`. Each language has its own syntax, but once you understand one, switching between them isn’t that hard.
