## <HoverUnderline>What are Arrays?</HoverUnderline>

An array is one of the simplest and most commonly used data structures in programming. I like to think of it as a collection of items (like numbers or strings) stored in a fixed-size container. What makes arrays special is that all the elements are stored in a **contiguous block of memory**. This means that all the elements are laid out side by side in memory, making it easy and fast to access any element using its **index**.

For example, if I want to get the 3rd element, I can directly go to its memory address by adding an offset to the start of the array. That’s why accessing elements in an array takes constant time, or `O(1)`.

## <HoverUnderline>Types of Arrays</HoverUnderline>

#### 1. One-Dimensional Arrays
This is the most basic type of array where elements are arranged in a straight line. Think of it like a list of items.

#### 2. Two-Dimensional Arrays
This is essentially a matrix, where data is stored in rows and columns. It's often used for grid-based problems like games or spreadsheets.

#### 3. Multi-Dimensional Arrays
If you go beyond 2D, you enter the world of 3D or even higher dimensions. These are less common but can be useful in scenarios like 3D modeling.

## <HoverUnderline>Memory Storage in Arrays</HoverUnderline>

Arrays are stored in **contiguous memory**, meaning all elements are stored one after another in a single block of memory. For example, if the first element is stored at memory location `1000`, and each element takes 4 bytes, the second element will be at `1004`, the third at `1008`, and so on. This is why arrays are so efficient for random access. However, this also means that you can't dynamically resize them without creating a new array.

## <HoverUnderline>Common Array Operations</HoverUnderline>

- **Access Operations**
  - Get element at index: `O(1)`
  - Set element at index: `O(1)`
  - Get array length: `O(1)`

- **Search Operations**
  - Linear Search: `O(n)`
  - Binary Search (sorted array): `O(log n)`
  - Find minimum/maximum: `O(n)`

- **Modification Operations**
  - Insert at end: `O(1)`
  - Insert at beginning/middle: `O(n)`
  - Delete from end: `O(1)`
  - Delete from beginning/middle: `O(n)`
  - Reverse array: `O(n)`
  - Rotate array: `O(n)`

## <HoverUnderline>Code Examples</HoverUnderline>

Here’s how you can define and use arrays in **C++**, **Python**, and **Java**. I've kept the examples simple, showing how to create, initialize, and access arrays.
