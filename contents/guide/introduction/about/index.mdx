## <HoverUnderline>About Algorithmik</HoverUnderline>

Hi, I’m <AnimatedUnderline>Mehul</AnimatedUnderline>, and this website is my way of helping you navigate data structures and algorithms (DSA). I’ve had a lot of people ask me how to get started with DSA, improve their LeetCode skills, or increase their contest ratings. I know how overwhelming it can feel at first, so I decided to create this site to share what I’ve learned to help others on their journey.

### <HoverUnderline>About Me</HoverUnderline>

I’m a pre-final year university student with a deep love for development, problem-solving, algorithms, and computer science in general. Here are some of my achievements in the DSA space:  
- <AnimatedUnderline>**Guardian on LeetCode**</AnimatedUnderline>, with a peak rating of **2284**, placing me in the top **0.68%** globally.  
- Solved over <AnimatedUnderline>**1500+ problems**</AnimatedUnderline> across different platforms, with extensive experience in C++ and Python. 
- Ranked <AnimatedUnderline>**513th in India**</AnimatedUnderline>, and <AnimatedUnderline>**3966th globally**</AnimatedUnderline> on LeetCode. 
- I have authored over 300 solutions on LeetCode across different accounts, earning more than <AnimatedUnderline>**700 upvotes**</AnimatedUnderline> and garnering over <AnimatedUnderline>**156,700 views**</AnimatedUnderline>.

### <HoverUnderline>Why This Website?</HoverUnderline>

I know that there are already a lot of DSA websites out there, some paid and some free. The free ones often lack structure or have outdated content. While the paid ones are decent, I believe that it’s not required to pay for a DSA resource. You are mostly paying for the structure and if you can get that structure for free then there's no point in paying for it.

- <AnimatedUnderline>**Free and easy-to-use**</AnimatedUnderline>: Algorithmik is a free, comprehensive, and easy-to-use resource for learning DSA.  
- <AnimatedUnderline>**Open-source**</AnimatedUnderline>: Since it's open-source, you can contribute to it and make it even better.  
- <AnimatedUnderline>**Community-driven**</AnimatedUnderline>: You can help others out and contribute to the website by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or even adding your own content like submitting good problems or notes for a specific topic.
