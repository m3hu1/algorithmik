## About Algorithms with Mehul

Hi, I’m **Mehul**, and this website is my way of helping you navigate data structures and algorithms (DSA). I’ve had a lot of people ask me how to get started with DSA, improve their LeetCode skills, or increase their contest ratings. I know how overwhelming it can feel at first, so I decided to create this site to share what I’ve learned and help others on their journey.

With this website, I tried to make a structured guide to mastering DSA—from understanding the basics to solving advanced problems. My goal is to show that DSA isn’t as scary as it seems. It’s not just about preparing for interviews; it’s about learning how to think logically and solve problems efficiently. Through step-by-step explanations, and problem lists, I hope to make learning DSA both approachable and interesting for you.

### About Me

I’m a pre-final year university student with a deep love for computer science, development, algorithms, and problem-solving. Here’s a bit about my background:  
- **Guardian on LeetCode**, with a peak rating of **2284**, placing me in the top **0.68%** globally.  
- Solved over **1500+ problems**, gaining extensive experience in C++ and Python. 
- Been a fan of computers ever since childhood, and over the years, I've kept learning and exploring various aspects of technology.  

For me, DSA is more than just a tool for cracking interviews. I love exploring algorithms, not just for their utility but for the stories, principles, and ideas behind them.

### Why This Website?

The world of DSA is often seen as daunting, but I believe that with the right mindset and resources, it can be approachable and even enjoyable. I created **Algorithms by Mehul** to:  
1. **Show that DSA is not scary**: It’s a skill that can be developed step by step.  
2. **Encourage learning for fun, not just interviews**: Algorithms are much more than tools for landing jobs—they’re the foundation of computational thinking.  
3. **Share my learning journey**: I’m not just a solver; I’m a learner, and I want to share my experiences and insights.  
4. **Provide a structured learning path**: This website serves as a guide, roadmap, or even a digital book for anyone looking to master DSA.  

### What You’ll Find Here

This website is designed to be a one-stop resource for anyone interested in DSA. It includes:
