## What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target element in a sorted array. Instead of checking each element one by one, it divides the search space in half with every step, making it incredibly fast for large datasets.

### How the Algorithm Works

Here’s how Binary Search works:

1. Start with two pointers: one pointing to the beginning (`low`) and the other to the end (`high`) of the array.
2. Find the middle element (`mid`) of the current search space.
3. Compare the middle element with the target:
   - If it matches the target, the search is complete.
   - If the target is smaller, narrow the search to the left half by moving the `high` pointer.
   - If the target is larger, narrow the search to the right half by moving the `low` pointer.
4. Repeat the process until the target is found or the pointers cross.

I think the beauty of Binary Search lies in its simplicity and the way it drastically reduces the number of elements to check.

### Time & Space Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`, because we halve the search space at every step.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for the iterative version, as no extra memory is used. For the recursive version, it’s `O(log n)` due to the call stack.

### When to Use

Binary Search is your go-to algorithm when:

- The dataset is sorted.
- You need to quickly find an element or check for its existence.

It’s widely used in problems where searching is involved, like finding the square root, searching in rotated arrays, or even solving optimization problems.
