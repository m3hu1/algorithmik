## <HoverUnderline>Learning Strategy</HoverUnderline>

1. **Daily Practice**
   - Solve at least 2-3 problems daily
   - Implement each data structure from scratch
   - Focus on clean, efficient code

2. **Contest Participation**
   - Join weekly coding contests
   - Practice time management
   - Learn from editorial solutions

3. **Review and Revision**
   - Maintain a problem-solving journal
   - Review difficult problems weekly
   - Practice previously solved problems

Remember: Consistency is key. Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than rushing through problems.
