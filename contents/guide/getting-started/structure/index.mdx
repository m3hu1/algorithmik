## <HoverUnderline>Structure</HoverUnderline>

To make this guide easy to follow, I've organized the website into several main sections. Here's how it's laid out:

1. **Prerequisites**: Before diving into complex topics, this folder ensures you have the fundamental knowledge needed:
   - Basic programming concepts
   - Algorithmic complexity
   - Mathematical foundations
   - Recursion and other core concepts
   - [Prerequisites](../prerequisites)

2. **Data Structures**: This section covers essential data structures like:
   - Arrays and strings
   - Linked lists
   - Stacks and queues
   - Trees and graphs
   - Hash tables and more
   - [Data Structures](../data-structures)

3. **Algorithms**: Once you're comfortable with data structures, we move on to algorithms:
   - Sorting algorithms
   - Searching algorithms
   - Dynamic programming
   - Graph algorithms
   - Pattern-based approaches
   - [Algorithms](../algorithms)

4. **Problem Sets**: This folder contains carefully curated problems to practice:
   - Company-wise interview problems from the past 6 months
   - Important problems that are frequently asked
   - Links to recommended LeetCode problem lists
   - Topic-wise practice problems
   - [Problem Sets](../problem-sets)

5. **Miscellaneous**: Additional helpful resources:
   - Algorithmic complexity table for quick reference
   - Interview preparation tips
   - Language-specific implementations
   - Other useful resources
   - [Miscellaneous](../misc)

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a structured learning path. Whether you're preparing for interviews or building a strong foundation in DSA, you'll find resources tailored to your needs.

The content in each section serves two purposes:
1. Comprehensive learning material for first-time study
2. Quick reference notes for revision before interviews
