## <HoverUnderline>Structure</HoverUnderline>

To make this guide easy to follow, I’ve organized the website into a few main folders. Here’s how it’s laid out:

1. **Data Structures**: We start with the fundamentals—covering essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. This section will walk you through each data structure, explaining how it works, common operations, and examples of where it’s used.

2. **Algorithms**: Once you’re comfortable with data structures, we move on to algorithms. This folder covers key algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and others. Each topic includes explanations, code samples, and tips on how to approach different types of problems.

3. **Problem Sets**: This folder contains curated lists of problems to help you practice and apply what you’ve learned. These lists are organized by topic and difficulty, making it easy for you to track your progress and challenge yourself as you go.

With this structure, you’ll have a clear path from learning the basics to tackling more complex problems. Whether you’re just starting or looking to refine your skills, each section is designed to build on the last, helping you steadily advance in your DSA journey.
