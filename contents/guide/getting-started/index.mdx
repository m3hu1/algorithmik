## <HoverUnderline>Learning Methodology</HoverUnderline>

The approach is designed to be both comprehensive for initial learning and convenient for quick revision:

1. **Resource-First Learning**: Learn from carefully selected resources
2. **Strong Foundation**: Master prerequisites before advanced topics
3. **Practice-Oriented**: Apply knowledge through curated problem sets
4. **Quick Reference**: Use guide sections as revision notes
