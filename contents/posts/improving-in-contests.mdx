## Stop Solving Random Problems — Focus on Contest Patterns

Let's start with the hard truth: solving random problems on LeetCode every day won't necessarily help you excel in contests. Contest problems follow distinct patterns, and the third and fourth problems often demand knowledge of niche algorithms like **Z-algorithm**, **KMP**, or advanced data structures. If you're not actively learning and practicing these, you'll find yourself stuck during contests.

Here’s the takeaway: **targeted practice beats random practice**. Start identifying patterns and concepts that frequently appear in contest problems and build your expertise in them.

## Learn to Thrive Under Time Pressure

One of the biggest challenges in contests is solving problems under strict time constraints. This is a skill in itself and takes time to master. You might know how to solve a problem in theory, but can you implement it under pressure?

Here’s what you can do:
- **Practice with a timer:** Set realistic time limits for yourself while solving problems.
- **Simulate contest conditions:** Try to complete entire problems in one sitting without distractions.
- **Upsolve regularly:** After every contest, solve the problems you couldn’t finish during the contest. Focus especially on the harder problems.

Over time, you'll become more comfortable handling the pressure, and your efficiency will improve.

## Understand That Ratings Are Secondary

Yes, seeing your contest rating increase feels amazing. But don't let it be your sole motivation. Ratings fluctuate, and sometimes external factors (like tougher contests to deter cheaters) might impact your performance. **What really matters is your understanding of concepts and problem-solving confidence.**

Keep this in mind:
- Interviewers rarely care about your rating. They care about how well you understand and apply concepts.
- Focus on learning and improving rather than chasing a number.

## Master the Niche Algorithms

As mentioned earlier, contest problems often require niche algorithms that are less likely to appear in everyday problem-solving. Algorithms like **Z-function**, **KMP**, **Segment Trees**, or **Mo’s Algorithm** can give you an edge.

Here’s how to get started:
1. Make a list of advanced topics and algorithms commonly used in contests.
2. Study and implement them from scratch.
3. Practice problems specifically designed for these algorithms.

The more tools you have in your problem-solving arsenal, the better prepared you'll be for contests.

## Review and Upsolve Previous Contests

One of the most effective ways to improve is to review problems from past contests:
- Solve problems from contests you’ve already participated in but couldn’t finish during the event.
- Attempt problems from older contests by going to the last page of the problems list on LeetCode.

Upsolving teaches you how to approach unfamiliar problems and fills gaps in your knowledge.

## Everyone's Journey Is Different

Improvement in contests takes time, and everyone progresses at their own pace. Some might reach high ratings like Guardian after 10 contests, while others might take 100. **What matters is that you don’t give up.**

Keep your focus on:
- Building problem-solving skills.
- Learning new concepts and techniques.
- Having fun while solving challenging problems.

Success in contests isn’t just about reaching a specific rating—it's about growing as a coder.

## TLDR: Focus on Learning and Growth

Here’s a quick summary:
- Stop solving random problems; focus on contest patterns.
- Practice solving problems under time pressure.
- Learn niche algorithms that frequently appear in contests.
- Upsolve contest problems and solve problems from previous contests.
- Don’t chase ratings—chase understanding and improvement.
- Remember, everyone progresses at their own pace.

Stay consistent, enjoy the process, and your rating will naturally follow.
