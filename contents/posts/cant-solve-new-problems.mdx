## It's Okay. Seriously, It Happens to Everyone.

Even after solving **300-400 Leetcode problems**, I still struggled with new problems. It’s frustrating, sure, but it’s also completely normal. Solving problems isn’t about memorizing solutions—it’s about recognizing **patterns**, understanding **concepts**, and applying them to new situations.

No one becomes a master overnight, and struggling doesn’t mean you’re bad at problem-solving. It means you’re learning.

## Pattern Recognition: The Real Superpower

When I say "patterns," I mean recurring themes or approaches that appear in many problems. For example:

- **Sliding Window**
- **Binary Search**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Traversals, etc.**

At first, these might feel overwhelming, but as you practice, you’ll start recognizing them naturally. Problems that seemed impossible before will suddenly "click." **That’s the magic of patterns.**

Here’s a tip: After solving a problem, take a moment to identify its core pattern. This will help you next time you encounter a similar question.

## Why Solving 100-150 Problems Isn’t Enough

Some people say, “If you solve 100-150 problems, you’re ready for interviews.” Honestly, that’s misleading. Here’s why:

- At that stage, you might just **memorize solutions** without truly understanding the "why" behind them.
- You won’t have encountered enough diverse problems to develop **intuitive problem-solving skills**.
- Tougher problems or interview variations might still catch you off guard.

Solving **300-400 problems** ensures you’ve covered a wider range of patterns and concepts. It’s not about hitting a magic number; it’s about gaining **depth of understanding**.

## It’s Not About Solving Every Problem

Let’s be realistic: No one can solve every single problem out there, and you don’t have to. Interviews are not competitions to see who can solve the most obscure question. Instead, they test:

- Your approach to problem-solving.
- Your ability to communicate your thought process.
- Your grasp of **fundamental concepts**.

Most interview questions are variations of common problems. If you’ve solved enough problems, you’ll recognize the pattern or get close to the solution. Interviewers often give hints or guide you, so your job is to **show clarity in your thinking** and **apply your knowledge effectively**.

## What to Do When You’re Stuck

Feeling stuck on a problem can be demoralizing, but here’s what I’ve learned:

1. **Break it Down**: Re-read the problem, break it into smaller parts, and see if it resembles anything you’ve solved before.
2. **Ask Why**: If you’re stuck on a concept, don’t just move on. Take the time to understand the "why" behind it.
3. **Reflect and Learn**: After solving a problem (even with help), reflect on what made it hard for you and what you learned.
4. **Practice More**: Every problem you struggle with makes you better prepared for the next one.

## TLDR

Struggling with new problems, even after solving hundreds? **It’s normal**. Focus on learning patterns, building concepts, and reflecting on your approach. You don’t need to solve every problem perfectly—what matters is developing the skills to tackle them with confidence. Keep grinding, stay consistent, and remember: **You’ve got this!**
